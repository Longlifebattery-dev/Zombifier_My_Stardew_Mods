## Freshness Features

* If you want an item that isn't usually part of a 'fresh' category benefit
  from 'freshness', add the `spoilable_item` context tag to the item data. This
  mod does this to Coffee Beans.
* Conversely, add the `non_spoilable_item` tag to make an item *not* eligible
  for freshness.
* Want to blanket add a context tag to spoilable or non-spoilable categories?
  See below in the "Modify the Competition" section.
* In-game, items marked Fresh will have the "fresh_item" context tags.
  Non-spoilable items will have the "non_spoilable_item" tag. To check for spoilable
  non-fresh items, use "!fresh_item" and "!non_spoilable_item".
* Item queries (shops, machines, etc.) will spawn Fresh items. To make them not fresh, add
  `"selph.FreshFarmProduce.NotFresh": "true"` to the item query's ModData field.

## Modify the Competition

You can specify your own farm competition categories and presets! See the
mod's included content pack for an example.

The mod reads competition data from the asset `selph.FreshFarmProduce/CompetitionData`, which has two fields:

| Field Name                         | Type             | Description              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| `Categories`              | `Dictionary<string, CategoryData>`           | A map of unique category IDs to their data. These don't do anything on their own, but is part of a competition Preset.|
| `Presets`              | `Dictionary<string, PresetData>`           | A map of unique preset IDs to their data. Presets control what categories will be enabled for the competition. A category can be part of multiple presets.|
| `SpoilableContextTags`              | `List<string>`           | A list of context tags. If an item has any of these tags it can be affected by freshness/staleness regardless of its category.|
| `NonSpoilableContextTags`              | `List<string>`           | A list of context tags. If an item has any of these tags it cannot be affected by freshness/staleness regardless of its category.|

`CategoryData` is a model with the following fields:

## Mail/Flags/Rewards
This mod's competition start logic and rewards are almost entirely handled in
the CP component, so feel free to edit them to change the timing/rewards/etc.
to your liking. The only things that are handled in C# are adding the following
mail flags to every player when the player finishes the competition or when it expires:

| Flag Name                         | Description              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `selph.FreshFarmProduce.Finished` | The contest is finished, and the farmer will not win any medals.|
| `selph.FreshFarmProduce.FinishedBronze` | The contest is finished, and the farmer will win a Bronze medal.|
| `selph.FreshFarmProduce.FinishedSilver` | The contest is finished, and the farmer will win a Silver medal.|
| `selph.FreshFarmProduce.FinishedGold` | The contest is finished, and the farmer will win a Gold medal.|
| `selph.FreshFarmProduce.FinishedIridium` | The contest is finished, and the farmer will win an Iridium medal.|
